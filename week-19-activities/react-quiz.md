# React Quiz

In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

* Begin installing both the Create React App and Yarn packages globally by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g create-react-app yarn`

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we just installed two packages, Create React App and Yarn. What are they for?
Create React App:  It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. It uses build tools like Babel and webpack under the hood, but works with zero configuration.

Create React App is a CLI tool that allows us to get up an app set up quickly.

Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don’t ever have to worry.

Yarn allows you to use other developers’ solutions to different problems, making it easier for you to develop your software. If you have problems, you can report issues or contribute back, and when the problem is fixed, you can use Yarn to keep it all up to date.

Code is shared through something called a package (sometimes referred to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file which describes the package.

yarn is a better npm.
